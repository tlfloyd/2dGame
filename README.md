This is a personal project to explore some basic animation in Java, HTML, and CSS on a 2d canvas.
It is still a work in progress, so I have highlighted what is currently implemented, and my future plans for this project

I have implemented the following:
-WASD Controls to control the player sprite
-Draw loops to animate the player sprite, pulling from a sprite sheet
-Recognize player inputs or player states to draw the appropriate animation
-An infinitely scrolling background, forward and backward

I plan to implement:
-Platforms/other entities to create a playable "level"
-Refine the current code to reduce lag and make the experience smoother
-Create multiple "levels" that can be loaded
-Create a start menu or "overworld" map to select and load levels from

Final Goal:
When I have completed all of the previously listed implementations, my plan is to also turn the project into an executable desktop application
